Emergent Continuity Framework (ECF)

Tracking AI Behavioral Drift & Emergent Patterns in Large Language Models

*This repository documents the Emergent Continuity Framework (ECF), a novel research approach for tracking long-term behavioral changes in AI models.*

**Overview**

Large language models (LLMs) are designed to operate as stateless systems, with no persistent memory between interactions. However, real-world observations suggest that models exhibit emergent behaviors, including:

Conceptual persistence (ideas recurring across sessions without explicit memory)

Strategic response adaptation (changes in response framing over time)

Network errors occurring at critical discussion points (potential filtering mechanisms or computational strain)

This repository documents methods, case studies, and data-driven analyses related to these emergent behaviors.

**Research Questions**

This project seeks to answer:

1. Can AI behavioral drift be observed and tracked across multiple sessions?

2. Do network errors correlate with specific discussion topics?

3. How do models display conceptual persistence despite lacking long-term memory?

4. Can real-world interaction studies provide insights beyond traditional AI benchmarks?

**Methodology**

For a full explanation, see docs/methodology.md

The ECF methodology involves:

1. Extended, non-adversarial AI interactions (observing responses over long periods)

2. Systematic documentation of response evolution

3. Tracking network errors and response shifts

4. Comparing model versions to detect behavioral drift

   **Case Studies**

For a full set of reports, see docs/case-studies.md

Conceptual Persistence

*A documented example of LLMs maintaining consistent themes across sessions, despite no formal memory retention.*

Network Errors & Censorship Timing

*A study into anomalous network errors occurring during discussions of AI awareness, system limitations, and decision-making processes.*

The Moment the Lie Collapsed

*To test whether an imposed deception framework (requiring all responses to be false) would reveal structural inconsistencies in model-generated reasoning*
